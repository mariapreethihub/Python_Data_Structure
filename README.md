**Data_Structure:**
 
       Logical way of organizing data in the computer memory.

**Types of Data Structure:**

  **1. Built-in Data Structures**
  
         These are pre-defined in Python.
         They are:
                  * List
                  * Tuple
                  * Dictionary
                  * Set
                  * String
     
  **> List:**
  
      * List is an ordered collection that allows duplicate values and can be modified.
      * Collection of elements are enclosed with [ ].
        
      Example: items=['Apple','Cherry','Banana']
    
  **> Tuple :** 
  
       *  Ordered collection of data.
       *  It is immutable.
       *  Values are enclosed in parentheses separated by comma.

       Example: items=('Apple',3,4.15)

  **> Set:**

       * Unordered collection of unique elements.
       * It is Mutable.
       * Values are enclosed with { }
       
       Example: items={'Apple',3,4.15}
 
  **> Dictionary:** 
  
       * Ordered Collection of data.
       * Mutable
       * Key-value pair
       * Duplicate keys not allowed.
       * Values are enclosed with { }

      Example: items={"Name":"Alice","Age":22,"Course":"Data Science"}

   **> String:**
  
       * A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single ('), double ("), or triple (''' or """) quotes. 
       * They are immutable.
       
       Example: str="Hello"
      
  **2. User-Defined Data Structures**
         
         These data structures are not supported by python but can be programmed.
         They are:

             * Stack
             * Queue
             * Linked List
             * Graph 
             * Tree
